In case that Syntax theme has a light background color, it only uses its hue, but otherwise stays dark. This lets you use dark-light combos.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atom/one-dark-ui/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/atom/one-dark-ui","_id":"one-dark-ui@0.5.0","_shasum":"d88106452302dc0d48d32e9688a5342558e2b1dd","_resolved":"file:../d-115114-7532-1v77h6a/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115114-7532-1v77h6a/package.tgz"}
